You can convert linear models to capture non-linear relationships using feature maps. 
If the feature map is a polynomial of x, the model is called polynomial regression.

The feature map gets applied once at the beginning to get the new features in the dataset. Then it is straightforward linear regression from there

The degree of the polynomial is a hyperparameter and can be tuned
